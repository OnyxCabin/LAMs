# LAMs!

Project to add Land-Air Mechs (LAMs) to HBS's Battletech game. Requires Expanded Arsenal 2.1. May work on 2.0, probably won't work on previous versions. Definitely won't work without it. A standalone version may be coming. Or not. We'll see how it goes.

## Installation

Unpack into your mods folder.

## Known Issues

1. LAM dropping with OpFor is way more common than I expected, even after tagging them as very rare.
2. The AI doesn't use them well. I've tagged them as flankers and long-range, but that doesn't really seem to come out in play. Maybe the AI just sucks
3. Sometimes LAM Aluminium Armor appears in salvage, even if there weren't any LAMs in the OpFor. Not sure why that happens, but if it does then you can install it on another mech.
